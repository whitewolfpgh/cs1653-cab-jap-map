FileSharing Usage Information

USAGE:
 To start Group Server: java MyGroupServer
 When the group server is first started, there are no users or groups. Since 
 there must be an administer of the system, the user is prompted via the console
 to enter a username. This name becomes the first user and is a member of the
 ADMIN group.  Also, no groups exist.  The group server will by default
 run on port 8765, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.  Currently only the default port is supported.

 To start the File Server: java MyFileServer
 The file server will create a shared_files inside the working directory if one 
 does not exist. The file server is now online.  The file server will by default
 run on port 4321, but a custom port can be passed as the first command line
 argument.  Currently only the default port is supported.

 To reset the File server completely, delete FileList.bin and the shared_files 
 directory.
 To reset the Group Server, delete UserList.bin.

 To reset both and clear shared files, run ./reinstall.sh
 
 Note that this implementation may or may not support server side directories,
 but that's solely based on whether or not the provided code also did.
